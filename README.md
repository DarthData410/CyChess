# Details:
This open source project contains elements, source code, graphics, sounds, etc. that support my Medium.com series of post about python3, pygame, C/C++, etc. This is meant to be used as a project for understanding how to build a classic chess game. This includes targeting different forms of AI.

This project is structured into named instances of the games source code and assets. Each instance is a copy of the previous named instance, building upon it to a new level of being a more complete game. 

The specific purpose of this project is to showcase/highlight the ability of cross platform interop for python3 & C/C++. This app contains a command line interface for testing and playing the full game from a *nix terminal. (Win code must be compiled separtely on that platform.)

    In this instance you will find the C/C++ code needed to correctly load/draw chess board, pieces, support piece movements by implementing movement rules, and turn based play. This instance will NOT contain any AI related "Computer Player" modes. As of this writing, completing the
